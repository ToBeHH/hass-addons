## About
This add-on provides an easy way to run the [LCN-PCHK](https://www.lcn.eu/en/lcn-tech/products/lcn-pchk/) service on the same hardware as your Home Assistant installation.

LCN-PCHK is a gateway software which provides access to the LCN bus system in conjunction with a USB or serial hardware gateway. The interface is used by the Home Assistant [LCN integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/lcn/).

LCN-PCHK is provided by Issendorff and is not included in this add-on. However, it will be automatically downloaded, installed and configured.
